# Swapso NFT Course Marketplace

Welcome to the Swapso - NFT Course Marketplace. This repository hosts the codebase for our innovative platform that allows users to buy and sell courses as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) within the Swapso ecosystem. Our marketplace revolutionizes the educational industry by offering a secure, transparent, and flexible platform for learners and course creators.

## Features

### 1. Buy and Sell Courses
- Users can purchase courses using Swapso tokens, acquiring ownership of the course in the form of NFTs.
- Buying a course mints a new NFT representing ownership, enabling users to access the course content.

### 2. Time-based Ownership
- Users have the flexibility to set the duration of ownership for purchased courses.
- If a user decides to sell a course before the ownership duration expires, the remaining duration is listed on the marketplace.

### 3. Earning Opportunities
- Users can earn from their course ownership by selling courses at a higher value or earning royalties from subsequent transactions.
- The platform provides opportunities for users to monetize their participation in the marketplace.

### 4. Smart Contract Integration
- Smart contracts govern the creation, transfer, and management of NFTs within the Swapso NFT Course Marketplace.
- These contracts ensure secure and transparent transactions, enhancing the reliability of the platform.
